/*
  Console Read example

 Read data coming from bridge using the Console.read() function
 and store it in a string.

 To see the Console, pick your YÃºn's name and IP address in the Port menu
 then open the Port Monitor. You can also see it by opening a terminal window
 and typing:
 ssh root@ yourYunsName.local 'telnet localhost 6571'
 then pressing enter. When prompted for the password, enter it.
